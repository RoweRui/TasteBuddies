      <h3>Welcome to TasteBuddies, where flavor meets friendship!</h3>
      <p>Founded in October 08, 2015, our mission is to celebrate the joy of food and the connections it creates. We believe that every meal is an opportunity to bond, share stories, and create lasting memories.</p>
      <br></br>
      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>TasteBuddies began with a simple idea: to bring food lovers together in a community where everyone can share their culinary experiences. It all started when our founder, Rowe Miller, hosted a dinner party for friends and discovered the magic that happens when people gather around a table. Inspired by the laughter, stories, and delicious dishes shared that evening, the vision for TasteBuddies was born.</p>
